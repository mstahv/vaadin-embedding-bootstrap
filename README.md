# An example project showing how to embed Vaadin into a Bootstrap based main layout

Bootstrap is one of the most common templates used for website Design. This example
shows how one can embed Vaadin applicaiton into a Bootsrap site. Technically speaking
we are doing it the vica versa: we are taking in CSS and html snippets from a 
[Bootstrap example](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples/pricing/) and embedding
those into a Vaadin application.

There are many ways to accomplish this kind of integration, of which two are showcased
in this repository. The examples are examples and the principles used can be adapted to 
other integrations as well.

## Using Lit templates & shadow DOM

The master branch uses shadow dom and wraps (almost all) Bootstrap
CSS into those, so that they can't disturb the actual Vaadin application. We take the
header and footer from the Bootstrap example and render a Vaadin application to the
main area of the page.

Things to check out in this implementation:

 * [bootstrap-element.ts](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-embedding-bootstrap/blob/master/frontend/views/bootstrap-element.ts) that provides a superclass for "bootstrap Lit templates". The Bootstrap CSS is defined in this class and will only be applied to shadow dom of the extending "bootstrap components".
 * [WebsiteHeader.java](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-embedding-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/org/vaadin/example/WebsiteHeader.java) and [website-header.ts](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-embedding-bootstrap/blob/master/frontend/views/website-header.ts) which wrap the header part of the example into a Lit template and a shadow DOM snippet.
 * Similar WebsiteFooter class
 * [MainLayout.java](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-embedding-bootstrap/blob/master/src/main/java/org/vaadin/example/MainLayout.java) that is used by the MainView example view. That brings in the "Bootstrap components" and places the actual view in middle.
 * [shared-styles.css](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-embedding-bootstrap/blob/master/frontend/styles/shared-styles.css) contains the custom css in the original example and a subset of Bootstrap CSS that needed outside the header and footer that are encapsulated inside shadow dom.

If shadow dom protection is not essential for you, a rather similar integration can be accomplished in a slightly simpler manner using [Html component](https://vaadin.com/api/platform/14.8.2/com/vaadin/flow/component/Html.html) or low level [Element API](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/element-api) and with [StyleSheet annotation](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/styling/importing-style-sheets).

## Overriding the default host page of the Vaadin application

The "modified_index_html" branch shows a bit simpler method. There we simply modify the
Vaadin generated "host page" to include the same example page, but instead of the default
content we render a Vaadin application, like in the previous.

Things to check out in this implementation:

 * The [index.html file](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-embedding-bootstrap/blob/modified-index-html/frontend/index.html), which is now committed over the default index.html file that gets 
   generated by Vaadin. The file contains pretty much the same as in the original Bootstrap Pricing example, but the Vaadin content div element is in the main part instead of the main content.
 * The [resources directory](https://github.com/mstahv/vaadin-embedding-bootstrap/tree/modified-index-html/src/main/resources/META-INF/resources), where static files are to be put in a Spring Boot project.
   This is where I put all the Bootstrap resources.

Note, the generated index.html file is only available in the most recent Vaadin Flow versions. If you are using Vaadin 14 series, similar effect can be accomplished using Java API and/or [BootstrapListener](https://vaadin.com/docs/v14/flow/advanced/tutorial-bootstrap/#bootstraplistener).

## Running the example

There are two ways to run the application :  using `mvn spring-boot:run` or by running the `Application` class directly from your IDE.
